# Cyclistic Case Study â€“ 2023

This project explores how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bike share services differently, using 12 months of data from 2023.

## Tools Used
- R (data cleaning and transformation)
- Tableau Public (interactive dashboard)

## Project Summary
The data was cleaned and enriched using R (see the R script above). Visualizations were built in Tableau to compare ride frequency, duration, and seasonal patterns between user types.

Due to size limits, the cleaned CSV dataset was not uploaded. However, the dashboard built on this data is available below.
